![Alt text](images/05-javascript-challenge-demo.png)
Above is the user interface.
All you have to do is click the red button which says "generate password".
Then you will be prompted with a couple of questions.
The questions will ask you if you would like a capital letter,lower-case letter, a number(s) or special character in your password.
You will answer these questions by click ok for yes and cancel for no.
The final question will tell you how long of a password you want. You would have to pick between 10-64.
If you pick a number out of this bracket you will be told to pick a number between this bracket. 

Straight foward to use enjoy!
